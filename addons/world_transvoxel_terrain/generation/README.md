# Generation Ownership

Generation profiles, deterministic source selection, offline-generation hooks,
and flat/reference profile definitions belong here.

Hot generation execution must not be implemented in GDScript.

A2 adds `WtTerrainGenerationProfile` as metadata only; it does not generate
density or meshes.

`WtTerrainGenerationProfile` also exposes the standard material strata contract:
palette version, stable material IDs, surface material IDs, and
`deep>=8:1,mid>=3:7,shallow>=1:4` underground depth bands. The authoritative
contract is
[../../../STANDARD_MATERIAL_STRATA_CONTRACT.md](../../../STANDARD_MATERIAL_STRATA_CONTRACT.md).

Vertical volume shape is part of generation ownership. Profiles expose
`world_chunk_count_y` and `world_chunk_origin_y`; downstream runtime bridges
must forward those values to native procedural startup when available. The
standard deep proof profile uses `world_chunk_count_y=16` and
`world_chunk_origin_y=-8`, producing 256 vertical cells from `-128` through
`127` for real underground/tunnel testing.
