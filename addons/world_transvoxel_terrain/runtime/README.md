# Runtime Ownership

Terrain root, profile binding, viewer binding, lifecycle, and high-level state
coordination belong here.

Runtime code may coordinate subsystem calls. It must not become a monolithic
chunk manager.

A2 adds `WtTerrainWorld` as a placeholder scene entry point with dependency
status reporting only.

A3 adds `WtWorldTransvoxelBridge`, a narrow `ClassDB` adapter that can read
official `world-transvoxel` identity/config status without starting terrain.

A4 phase 2 adds `WtTerrainEditBridge`, which maps terrain edit batches into
official `WorldTransvoxelEditTransaction` backend calls. Public
`WtTerrainWorld` lifecycle ownership remains the next A4 phase.

A4 phase 3 makes `WtTerrainWorld` own backend terrain/config instantiation,
start/stop, and edit-batch submission through the existing bridge classes.

A4 phase 4 adds public viewer update/removal, chunk query, runtime metrics, and
cold-idle summaries through `WtTerrainWorld`. `WtTerrainRuntimeAudit` owns the
focused cold-idle metric interpretation so the terrain-world node does not
become a monolithic runtime manager.

The downstream G46 terrain-addon API contract adds stable public aliases and
introspection on `WtTerrainWorld`: `start_world`, `stop_world`,
`is_world_running`, `get_world_state_name`, `get_world_revision`,
`get_world_source_revision`, `get_world_page_count`, profile summaries,
authoritative sample request methods/signals, storage snapshot request wrappers,
runtime telemetry, debug snapshot capture, `get_hot_path_boundary_summary`, and
`get_terrain_api_contract_summary`.

G48 uses `get_hot_path_boundary_summary` to lock the native hot-path boundary.
Generation, meshing, streaming, edit application, and storage stay in the
`world-transvoxel` native backend. Runtime GDScript may own bounded
lifecycle/profile/request wrappers, but it must not implement density volume
loops, mesh construction loops, page generation loops, source-file streaming
loops, or image/pixel terrain loops.
