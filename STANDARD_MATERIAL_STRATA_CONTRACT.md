# Standard material strata contract

Status: current terrain-addon material boundary.

This addon treats material as authoritative voxel sample data, not as a
shader-only presentation choice. Render UVs, textures, tints, screenshots, and
debug overlays are derived from the material samples.

## Current standard palette

The current standard material palette is
`world_transvoxel_material_palette_v1`.

| ID | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Deep stone / stable deep underground material |
| 2 | Lowland surface material |
| 3 | Dry surface soil material |
| 4 | Shallow surface sand / default player-placed fill material |
| 7 | Mid-depth rock / high exposed rock material |

These IDs are stable addon-facing meanings. Games may bind different textures
to the IDs, but the terrain authority and edit journals must preserve the IDs.

## Current procedural depth bands

The current deterministic and flat reference generators use
`standard_density_depth_material_strata_v1`:

```text
deep>=8:1,mid>=3:7,shallow>=1:4
```

Depth means `surface_y - sample_y` for the initial procedural source. This gives
the current minimum standard:

- solid samples at least 1 block below the surface use material `4`;
- solid samples at least 3 blocks below the surface use material `7`;
- solid samples at least 8 blocks below the surface use material `1`;
- near-surface and above-surface samples may carry surface material IDs
  `2`, `3`, `4`, or `7` so the mesher can derive the visible surface palette.

The flat baseline uses the same material rules as the mountainous profile. It is
not a separate heightmap-only material path.

## Required behavior

- `WtTerrainGenerationProfile.get_contract_summary()` must expose the material
  model, palette version, standard material IDs, surface material IDs, and depth
  bands.
- Authoritative sample queries must return the expected shallow, mid, and deep
  material IDs for standard profiles.
- Edits mutate density and material together. A construct/place edit using
  material `4` is player fill, not a separate hidden terrain layer.
- Rendering may use texture atlases, triplanar mapping, or clean human-playtest
  materials, but rendering must not become authoritative terrain state.
- Do not add duplicate terrain skins, double-sided materials, or full-map
  fallback layers to hide material or topology problems.

## Current non-goals

This contract does not yet claim a complete biome system, ore veins, material
blending, erosion, collapse simulation, vegetation, water/lava, or multiplayer
replication policy. Those systems must preserve this density/material authority
instead of replacing it with a presentation-only material model.
